# Ilastik
You can download Ilastik [here](https://www.ilastik.org/). 

Ilastik is a pixel based classifier, that works in both 2D and 3D. It is very powerful at segmentation by color, intensity, texture and other pixel based parameters. 
To use it, you "simply" paint with your mouse cursor the background of your image, as well as representative regions that you are trying to segment. 
This is done iteratively to create a good pixel classifier that can be run on many images, either through Ilastik or imported into your FIJI or CellProfiler pipelines.  
We support Ilastik on some of our [Image Analysis Workstations](https://github.com/FrancisCrickInstitute/CALM/wiki/Workstations) and on the Nemo Compute Cluster (HPC).
